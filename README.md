# Using VBA for Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
In order to provide Steve with an expanded dataset for the entire stock market from 2017 and 2018, the existing  VBA code would need to be refactored in order to provide sufficient data for Steve to help his parents determine other stocks that are worth investing in.    Refactoring the current code would provide the ability to pull a larger data set without additional slowness.

## Results

Based on the final data it appears the stocks listed were in a better space in  2017 over 2018.    This could be due to economic situations during 2018 that cannot be captured using VBA Coding.      
The best that can be done with this data is to review the only two stocks that provided positive returns for both years, RUN and ENPH.

Before finalizing my refactored code, I made sure to make a copy of the original code so I can recopy shoudl I come across any issues.  I can say it saved me a fews times as I did get stuck a lot and had to start over a few times.
Ensuring to have a copy of the original as well as make copies on long the way  helps to lessen the frustration when having to start over at a given point.

##Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code:
Refactoring code helps to be able to reorganize the previous code to ensure it correctly captures the data for a broader range of data.    Being able to pull more data to get a broader perspective
as well as be able to run the script faster (refactored code ran five seconds faster than original) is beneficial  and of course who does not like faster results.    Along with keeping the code cleaner and organized 
not only for yourself but for others as well should the coding is needed for future reference.   A disadvantage that could occurr is if the data is too large where an application would not be able to properly handle
or if the original code is undecipherable to be able to refactor.   Some times having to much can cause confusion as to what is actually being done.
